I asked a friend if i could build a site for him to show case his art. I already had the Masonry layout in my head, and
saw this as the perfect oppurtunity to get to know the plugin.

The layout works well, I am busy adding functionality through the plugin to move the pictures and add and remove.

All credit must go to David Desandro, fantastic plugin, get it here http://masonry.desandro.com
